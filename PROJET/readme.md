# Mental Health Chatbot

This project focuses on developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered chatbot for addressing mental health concerns.

## Overview

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, yet it often goes unnoticed or unaddressed. This project aims to bridge the gap between individuals seeking mental health support and available resources through the use of a chatbot. By leveraging NLP techniques, the chatbot can engage in conversations, provide information, and offer support tailored to the user's needs.

## Features
- **Conversational Interface**: The chatbot provides a user-friendly conversational interface where individuals can express their concerns and receive personalized responses.

- **NLP Capabilities**: Powered by advanced NLP techniques, the chatbot can understand user input, analyze context, and generate appropriate responses.

- **Mental Health Resources**: The chatbot offers information about various mental health conditions, coping strategies, and available resources such as hotlines and support groups.

- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Ensuring user privacy and confidentiality is a top priority. The chatbot follows best practices for data security and confidentiality.
